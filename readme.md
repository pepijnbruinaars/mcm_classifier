### MCM Classifier
This is a WIP MCM-based naive Bayes' classifier. It is a very simple classifier that uses fitted Minimally Complex Models to classify data. More information on MCMs and the way they're fitted can be found [here](https://github.com/clelidm/MinCompSpin), [here](https://github.com/clelidm/MinCompSpin_Greedy) and [here](https://github.com/ebokai/MinCompSpin_SimulatedAnnealing).

Classification using statistical models has the benefit of being able to classify data and giving a confidence value for the classification.
